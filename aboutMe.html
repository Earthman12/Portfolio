                <h2>Brief Summary</h2>
                <p>I was born in Phoenix, AZ where I lived until I graduated from Thunderbird high school and went to the University of Arizona
                    in Tucson where I had lived for eight years before recently moving back. I have experience in engineering and computers
                    both assembling, maintaining, and coding (Python, Java, C/C++, Javascript, HTML, and CSS) as well as a strong background
                    in math, physics, and astronomy.

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>I got my first job right after my junior year of high school ended at a dry cleaners where I worked until I left for
                    college in August the following year and would come back and work shifts every so often after that. My job there
                    required me to interact with customers on a daily basis which taught me many social and communication skills.
                </p>

                <p>My next job was a Sales Associate position at Tuesday Morning that I had for a short while in summer between my 
                    sophomore and junior year of college. This job mostly required me to wait on customers which would 
                    only help make me become a better people person. 
                </p>
                
                <p>The following February would be when I decided I would be able to handle the load of school and a job and I  got my
                    next job in the University Rec Center at its healthy eatery working as a Student Worker. My duties here mainly consisted
                    of making the food, cleaning and shutting down the kitchen at night, closing the restaurant and prepping for the next morning.
                    Working here not only gave me more customer experience but also effective teamwork.
                </p>
                
                <p>While working at the Rec Center in the Summer of 2016, I had met Dr. Jason Corliss while roaming the halls of the Lunar & Planetary
                    Lab seeking an advisor.
                    After talking for 10 minutes, I was instead offered a position doing research work for him and Dr. Walter Harris on campus
                    in their lab.
                    Their observational research consisted of studying planetary atmospheres and their transition to and interactions
                    with the space environment while the other side of research is focused on instrument development of
                    spatial heterodyne spectroscopy (SHS).
                    The goal is to launch their SHS instrument on a sounding rocket provided through the NASA program so that it may take data above
                    the atmosphere.
                    I was hired based on my background in Engineering and Computer Science and interest in Physics.
                    While it is hard to say exactly what my role was in this team, I handled a lot of mechanical designs,
                    writing code, and computer hardware/software maintenance but also have a great amount experience in optics and optical alignment. 
                    This job not only helped solidify the experience I had learned from previous ones but gave me so many opportunities to expand
                    my knowledge immensely and that it is what I admired most about working there.
