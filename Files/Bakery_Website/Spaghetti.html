                <ul>
                    <li>
                        1 pound ground beef
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1 pound ground sausage
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        24 ounce pasta sauce
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        12 ounce tomato paste (6 ounce cans x 2)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        24 ounces water
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Noodles of choice
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Seasonings of choice
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        On a large pan, cook the ground beef and sausage long enough to give it color but not completely cooked through
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the meat has cooked enough, dump it in a colander to remove the grease and place in a slow cooker on low
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition to the meat, add the pasta sauce, water, tomato paste and seasonings and mix together. The seasonings
                        of my choice are garlic salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and a small amount of chiltepin pepper
                        for some spice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let the pasta sauce cook for 2 1/2 hours while stirring and tasting every hour
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set the temperature to high and cook for an additional 1 1/2 hours and plate with noodles
                    </li>
                </ol>
