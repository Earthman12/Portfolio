                        Place cake mix, pudding, eggs, oil, and milk in large mixing bowl and beat for a minute.
                            Scrape sides and beat again for another two minutes until smooth
                    </li>

                        Pour batter into greased 9x13 baking dish and bake at 350F for 30-35 minutes or until golden.
                            Will be ready when a tooth pick can be placed in the center and comes out clean
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While cake is baking, place pineapple and sugar into medium saucepan on stovetop and bring to a
                            boil over medium high heat while constantly stirring until sugar dissolves and remove from heat
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once cake is done, remove from oven and poke lots of holes on the surface and pour the hot
                            pineapple mix over the top and spread and allow to cool
