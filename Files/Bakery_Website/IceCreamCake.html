                <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Bake cake in cake pan and cut into 3 sections (cake will stack from bottom: cake => ice cream => cake => ice cream => cake => frosting => sprinkles)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allow ice cream to soften to make it easier to spread
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place a piece of baking paper on bottom of same cake pan to avoid sticking and place bottom part of cake on top followed by a layer of ice cream
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spread ice cream so that it is flat and evenly distributed across cake and place another layer of cake and ice cream on top.
                            Add the top layer of cake and press down lightly so that it sets evenly and freeze over night
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take cake out of freezer and out of cake pan and add frosting all around
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Grab large handfuls of sprinkles and place them all around the sides of the cake first by slightly tilting the cake and taking the sprinkles up the
                            sides letting them fall off your hand onto the frosting. Add sprinkles to top to finish
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Freeze until ready to serve
                    </li>
